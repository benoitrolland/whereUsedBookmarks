# WhereUsedBookmarks

In the bookmark sidebar, bookmarks search results are provided as a list
with no information about its location in the tree,
despite it is likely usefull to access siblings of bookmarks found.

I see several possible implementations:

    * unfold result with all parent folders, then show all childs on folder selection
    * unfold path and show siblings on specific right-click context menu "whereUsed"
    * reload the full bookmark view, still selecting the bookmark from witch the context "whereUsed" menu was clicked on.
    * put the folder-path as link to parent folder as an additional properties information.
    * best implementation would provides the list of inverted folder path as menus or like, allowing to reach ancestors folders at any level.

1: Adding context menu on bookmark sidebar (on search-results)
Tim Nguyen could open an API for a context menu on bookmarks in December 2017, 
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1370499
but it was postponed, because of some trickyness, where we need it: in the sidebar and bookmark library
